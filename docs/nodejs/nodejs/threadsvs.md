<summary><h5>single-thread vs multi-threads vs concurrency vs paralell in Nodejs</h5></summary>

Single-thread, multi-threads, concurrency, and parallelism in simple words.

- **Single-thread**: Imagine you are a waiter in a small restaurant. ***You have to serve one table of customers at a time***. You can only do one thing at a time, like taking orders, bringing food, or collecting bills. You don't share any resources with anyone else. You are doing single-thread, running one task at a time.
- **Multi-threads**: Imagine you are a waiter in a bigger restaurant. ***You have to serve multiple tables of customers***. Each table is like a thread, a separate task that you have to do. You can switch between tables and do different things for them, like taking orders, bringing food, or collecting bills. You share some resources with other waiters, like the kitchen or the cash register.
- **Concurrency**: Imagine you are the only waiter in a busy restaurant. ***You have to serve multiple tables of customers at the same time***. You can't be at two places at once, so you have to divide your time and attention between them. You are doing concurrency, handling multiple tasks that overlap in time. Sometimes you have to wait for something, like the food to be ready or the customer to pay. While you are waiting, you can do something else for another table.
- **Parallelism**: Imagine you have some helpers in the restaurant. ***They can help you with some tasks***, like taking orders or bringing food. They can work at the same time as you, using different parts of the restaurant. You are doing parallelism, executing multiple tasks simultaneously. You can serve more customers faster and more efficiently with their help.
