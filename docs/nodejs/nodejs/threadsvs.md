<summary><h5>single-thread vs multi-threads vs concurrency vs paralell in Nodejs</h5></summary>

* **Single-thread:** A single-thread is like a single person doing a task. For example, ***a single person cooking a meal***. The person can only focus on one task at a time, and the meal will take longer to cook if the person is not very efficient.
* **Concurrency:** Concurrency is like multiple people doing different tasks at the same time. For example, ***a group of people cooking different meals***. The people are not working together, but they are all doing something at the same time.
* **Multi-thread:** A multi-thread is like multiple people doing a task together. For example, ***a group of people cooking a meal***. The people can focus on different tasks at the same time, and the meal will cook faster if the people are efficient.
> Multithreading is a way to achieve concurrency in software development. Concurrency is the ability to run multiple tasks or processes at the same time, and ***multithreading is a specific approach to implementing concurrency*** by dividing a program into multiple threads of execution that can run concurrently.
> Here is an example of how multithreading can be used to improve the performance of a request-response system:
> - A web server receives requests from multiple clients.
> - The server divides the requests into multiple tasks.
> - The server assigns each task to a different thread.
> - The threads execute the tasks concurrently.
> - The server returns the results of the tasks to the clients.
* **Parallelism:** Parallelism is like multiple people doing the same task at the same time. For example, ***a group of people running a race***. The people are all working towards the same goal, and they are all doing it at the same time.
> Consider a web server that receives requests from multiple clients. If the server only has one processor, it can only process one request at a time. However, if the server has multiple processors, it can process multiple requests simultaneously. This can be done by ***dividing the requests into multiple tasks and assigning each task to a different processor***.

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between single-thread, multi-thread, concurrency, and parallel:

| Feature | Single-thread | Multi-thread | Concurrency | Parallelism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Number of tasks | 1 | Multiple | Multiple | Multiple |
| Focus | One task at a time | Different tasks at the same time | Different tasks at the same time | Same task at the same time |
| Speed | Slow | Faster | Faster | Fastest |
| Example | A single person cooking a meal | A group of people cooking a meal | A group of people cooking different meals | A group of people running a race |
