  \***`◔̯◔`**\* :
  ### What cause Memory leak Issue in React Native?
There can be several causes for memory leaks in React Native applications. Here are a few common causes:

**1️⃣ Improper Management of Component State**: When the state of a component is not managed properly, it can lead to memory leaks. If a component stores data in its state that is no longer needed, it can cause the component to take up more memory than necessary.

**2️⃣ Excessive use of Timers and Listeners**: Overusing timers and listeners can also cause memory leaks. If a timer is not cleared or removed properly, it can continue to run and consume memory even when it's no longer needed. The same is true for listeners.

**3️⃣ Improper Use of Cache**: Cache can be used to store data, but if it's not used properly, it can create memory leaks. If the cache is not cleared or removed after use, it can continue to consume memory.

**4️⃣ Image and Data Loading**: Loading images and data can also cause memory leaks if it's not managed carefully. If too much data is loaded at once or images are not properly resized or disposed of, it can lead to memory leaks.

**5️⃣ Third-party Libraries**: Third-party libraries can also cause memory leaks if they're not designed and implemented properly. It's important to carefully review and test libraries before incorporating them into your application to ensure they don't cause memory leaks.

### How to detecting memory leaks for Android & IOS?

To detect memory leaks in React Native applications, you can use `XCode → Product → Profile (⌘ + i)` on IOS or `Monitor → Preferences` on Android.

### How to deal with memory leaks?

Here are a few ways to resolve memory leaks in React Native:

**1️⃣ Use stateless components**: Stateless components render faster than stateful components, and they're less likely to cause memory leaks.

**2️⃣ Remove event listeners**: Remove event listeners that are no longer required, as they can lead to excessive memory usage.

**3️⃣ Use the PureComponent class**: The PureComponent class optimizes rendering performance by reducing the number of re-renders that a component undergoes. This can help avoid memory leaks caused by excessive re-renders.

**4️⃣ Use setTimeout() and setInterval() appropriately**: Avoid using these JavaScript timers excessively, as they can cause memory leaks when not used properly.

By following these practices, you can detect and resolve memory leaks in your React Native application, ensuring that it runs smoothly and efficiently.
