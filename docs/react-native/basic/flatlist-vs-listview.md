  <summary><h5>ANSWER:</h5></summary>

  \***`◔̯◔`**\* :
`FlatList` and `ListView` are both components in React Native that allow you to render a scrollable list of items. While they serve the same purpose, they have some key differences in terms of performance and features.
Here are some differences between `FlatList` and `ListView`:

**Performance**: `FlatList` provides better performance than `ListView`. `ListView` keeps all items in the memory, while `FlatList` only renders the visible items, thus reducing the memory usage and improving the performance of the app. `FlatList` also uses a virtualized list which optimizes the rendering process by rendering only a subset of the items in the list based on the position of the user on the screen.

**Data management**: `FlatList` has better data management and item rendering capabilities than `ListView`. `FlatList` allows you to easily manage data by using the `data` and `renderItem` props, while in `ListView` you need to handle the data and item rendering manually.

**Item layout**: `FlatList` provides more flexibility and customization options for item layout. You can use the `horizontal` prop to render the items horizontally, and you can also use the `numColumns` prop to render the items in multiple columns.

**Scroll position**: `FlatList` provides better control over the scroll position than `ListView`. You can programmatically scroll to a specific position in the list using the `scrollToIndex` method or the `scrollToOffset` method.

In summary, while both `FlatList` and `ListView` provide the same basic functionality of rendering a scrollable list, `FlatList` provides better performance and more advanced features for data management, item rendering, and scroll position control.


:::note Note:

`ListView` is deprecated now
