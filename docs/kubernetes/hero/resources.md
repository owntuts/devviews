<summary><h5>Kubernetes Resources</h5></summary>

Kubernetes resource types are the kinds of objects that you can create and manage in a Kubernetes cluster. There are two main categories of resource types: workloads and services. 

1. **Workloads** are the resources that run your applications, such as ***pods, deployments, replica sets, stateful sets, daemon sets, jobs, and cron jobs***. 
2. **Services** are the resources that expose your applications to the network, such as ***services, ingresses, and network policies***. 
3. In addition to these core resource types, there are also other resource types that support various aspects of cluster management, such as ***config maps, secrets, persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, service accounts, roles, role bindings, cluster roles, cluster role bindings, and custom resource definitions***.

Each resource type has a specific structure and behavior that defines its state and functionality. You can use the Kubernetes API or the kubectl command-line tool to create, update, delete, and query these resources. You can also use configuration files to specify the desired state of your resources declaratively.
