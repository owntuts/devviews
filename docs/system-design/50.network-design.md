  <summary><h5>Distributed vs Decentralize Architecture</h5></summary>

Distributed and decentralized architectures are both types of network designs that differ from centralized architectures. 
- **A centralized architecture** is where all the nodes or components of the system are connected to and ***controlled by a single central*** node or server. 
- **A distributed architecture** is where the nodes or components of the system are ***located on different machines or networks***, and communicate with each other to achieve a common goal. 
- **A decentralized architecture** is where the nodes or components of the system are ***independent and autonomous***, and ***do not rely on a central*** node or server to coordinate their actions.

Some of the differences between distributed and decentralized architectures are:

- **Control**: In a distributed architecture, there may still be some level of control or hierarchy among the nodes, such as a master-slave or client-server relationship. In a decentralized architecture, there is no central authority or leader among the nodes, and they operate on a peer-to-peer basis.
- **Communication**: In a distributed architecture, the communication among the nodes may be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the protocol or algorithm used. In a decentralized architecture, the communication among the nodes is usually asynchronous and event-driven, based on messages or events.
- **Consistency**: In a distributed architecture, the consistency of the data or state among the nodes may vary, depending on the trade-off between availability and partition tolerance. In a decentralized architecture, the consistency of the data or state among the nodes is usually eventual or probabilistic, based on consensus mechanisms.

Some of the advantages of distributed and **decentralized architectures over centralized architectures** are:

- **Scalability**: Distributed and decentralized architectures can scale up or down the resources according to the demand or load of the system, improving the performance and availability of the system.
- **Fault tolerance**: Distributed and decentralized architectures can tolerate failures or errors in some nodes, without compromising the functionality or reliability of the system.
- **Diversity**: Distributed and decentralized architectures can use different technologies or platforms that suit their specific needs or preferences, enabling innovation and flexibility.

Some of the challenges of ***distributed and decentralized architectures compared to centralized architectures*** are:

- **Complexity**: Distributed and decentralized architectures are more complex to design, develop, test, and maintain than centralized architectures, requiring more coordination and synchronization among nodes.
- **Security**: Distributed and decentralized architectures are more vulnerable to attacks or breaches than centralized architectures, requiring more protection and encryption of the data and communication.
- **Latency**: Distributed and decentralized architectures may have higher latency or delay than centralized architectures, due to network congestion or failures.

  <summary><h5>Examples of distributed and decentralized architectures</h5></summary>

- **Distributed architectures**: These are architectures where the nodes or components of the system are located on different machines or networks, and communicate with each other to achieve a common goal. Some examples are:
  - Distributed databases: These are databases that split the data into parts and store them on different nodes for faster access and scalability. For example, MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, etc.
  - Distributed computing: These are computing systems that use multiple nodes to perform parallel or distributed processing of large-scale tasks or problems. For example, MapReduce, Spark, Hadoop, etc.
  - Distributed file systems: These are file systems that store files across multiple nodes for high availability and fault tolerance. For example, HDFS, Ceph, GlusterFS, etc.

- **Decentralized architectures**: These are architectures where the nodes or components of the system are independent and autonomous, and do not rely on a central node or server to coordinate their actions. Some examples are:
  - Peer-to-peer networks: These are networks where the nodes communicate and share resources directly with each other, without intermediaries or central servers. For example, BitTorrent, Tor, IPFS, etc.
  - Blockchain networks: These are networks where the nodes maintain a shared and immutable ledger of transactions or data, using consensus mechanisms and cryptography. For example, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, etc.
  - Decentralized applications: These are applications that run on blockchain networks or peer-to-peer networks, without centralized servers or authorities. For example, Uniswap, Compound, Brave, etc.
