# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

Design patterns are classified into three categories based on their purpose or intent: creational, structural, and behavioral.

- **Creational patterns** deal with object creation and initialization. They provide a way to ***encapsulate the logic of creating objects and hiding the implementation details from the client***. Some examples of creational patterns are `singleton`, `factory method`, `abstract factory`, `builder`, `prototype`, and `object pool`.
- **Structural patterns** describe how to use objects to form larger structures. They ***provide a way to compose objects into more complex and flexible configurations***. Some examples of structural patterns are `adapter`, `bridge`, `composite`, `decorator`, `facade`, `flyweight`, and `proxy`.
- **Behavioral patterns** define ***how objects interact and communicate***. They provide a way to specify the responsibilities and collaborations of objects and classes. Some examples of behavioral patterns are `chain of responsibility`, `command`, `interpreter`, `iterator`, `mediator`, `memento`, `observer`, `state`, `strategy`, `template method`, and `visitor`.
