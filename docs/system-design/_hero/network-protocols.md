<summary><h5>Network Protocols</h5></summary>

There are many types and categories of network protocols, depending on their functions, layers, and purposes. Some of the common network protocols and their functions are:

- **ARP**: Address Resolution Protocol. This protocol translates IP addresses to MAC addresses and vice versa so devices on a LAN can communicate with each other.
- **BGP**: Border Gateway Protocol. This protocol controls how packets pass through routers in different autonomous systems (networks run by a single organization or provider) and connect to the internet.
- **DNS**: Domain Name System. This protocol is a database that maps domain names (such as www.google.com) to IP addresses (such as 142.250.74.196) so devices can locate websites on the internet.
- **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol. This protocol enables the transfer of files between a client and a server over a network.
- HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This protocol defines how web browsers and web servers communicate and exchange data over the internet.
- **ICMP**: Internet Control Message Protocol. This protocol sends error and control messages between devices on a network, such as ping requests and replies.
- **IP**: Internet Protocol. This protocol is the main protocol of the internet that assigns unique addresses to devices and routes packets across networks.
- **IPv4**: Internet Protocol version 4. This protocol is the most widely used version of IP that uses 32-bit addresses to identify devices on the internet.
- **IPv6**: Internet Protocol version 6. This protocol is the newer version of IP that uses 128-bit addresses to identify devices on the internet and supports more devices than IPv4.
- **POP3**: Post Office Protocol version 3. This protocol enables email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server over a network.
- **SMTP**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. This protocol enables email clients to send emails to a mail server over a network.
- **TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol. This protocol provides reliable and ordered delivery of data between devices on a network by establishing connections and acknowledging packets.
- **UDP**: User Datagram Protocol. This protocol provides fast and unordered delivery of data between devices on a network without establishing connections or acknowledging packets.
