<summary><h5>Server-Server Communications</h5></summary>

- **Webhooks** are real time, meaning that they are triggered and sent as soon as the event occurs. They are a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. These callbacks are usually triggered by some event, such as a comment being posted to a blog or a payment being processed. When that event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook.
- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: This is a protocol that allows a server to invoke a function or a procedure on another server and get the result. RPC can use different formats and transports, such as XML-RPC, JSON-RPC, or gRPC. RPC is often used for distributed computing and microservices architectures.
- **Message Queue (MQ)**: This is a system that allows servers to exchange messages asynchronously through a queue or a broker. MQ can use different protocols and standards, such as AMQP, MQTT, or JMS. MQ is often used for decoupling components, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
- **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)**: This is a pattern that allows servers to communicate through topics or channels. A server can publish a message to a topic, and any other server that subscribes to that topic can receive the message. Pub/Sub can use different systems and platforms, such as Kafka, Redis, or AWS SNS. Pub/Sub is often used for event-driven architectures and real-time applications.
