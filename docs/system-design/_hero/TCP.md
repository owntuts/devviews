<summary><h5>TCP/IP Model</h5></summary>

| TCP/IP Model and its Layers | Real-life Analogy |
| --- | --- |
| **Application Layer**: It is a group of applications requiring network communications. This layer is responsible for ***generating the data and requesting connections***. It acts on behalf of the sender and the Network Access layer on behalf of the receiver. Some common protocols at this layer are ***HTTP, HTTPS, FTP***, etc. | Imagine you want to send a letter to your friend who lives in another city. You ***write the letter on a piece of paper and put it in an envelope***. This is like the Application Layer, where you generate the data and request a connection. |
| **Transport Layer**: It defines how applications can ***create channels of communication across a network***. It also manages how a ***message is assembled into smaller packets before they are then transmitted over the internet*** and reassembled in the right order at the destination address. The main protocols at this layer are ***TCP and UDP***. | Then you ***go to the post office*** and ***give them the envelope***. They ask you for the destination address and the sender address. They also stamp the envelope with a ***tracking number and a barcode***. This is like the Transport Layer, where you create a channel of communication and divide the data into packets with headers and footers. |
| **Network/Internet Layer**: It defines the protocols that are responsible for the logical transmission of data over the entire network. It also defines ***how to address and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination***. The main protocols at this layer are ***IP, ICMP, ARP***, etc. | The post office then sorts the envelopes according to their destination and puts them in different trucks. ***The trucks drive to different hubs or distribution centers***, where they are sorted again and forwarded to other trucks or planes. This is like the Network/Internet Layer, where you route the packets across the network using IP addresses and other protocols. |
| **Data Link Layer**: It identifies the packet's network protocol type, in this case TCP/IP, and ***provides error prevention and "framing" for the data***. It also handles the physical addressing of the packets by using MAC addresses. Some examples of data-link layer protocols are ***Ethernet, PPP***, etc. | The trucks or planes then deliver the envelopes to the local post offices in the destination city. ***The local post offices scan the barcodes and check the addresses on the envelopes***. They also check for any errors or damages on the envelopes. This is like the Data Link Layer, where you identify the protocol type and provide error prevention and framing using MAC addresses and other protocols. |
| **Physical Layer**: It defines the physical characteristics of the transmission medium, such as voltage levels, timing, connectors, etc. It also ***converts the digital bits into electrical signals or other forms of energy that can be transmitted over the medium***. | Finally, the local post office delivers the envelope to your friend's house. ***Your friend opens the envelope and reads your letter***. This is like the Physical Layer, where you transmit the data over the physical medium using electrical signals or other forms of energy. |
