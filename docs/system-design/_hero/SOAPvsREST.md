<summary><h5>SOAP vs REST</h5></summary>

SOAP and REST are two different ways to build APIs that transfer data over the Internet. ***SOAP is a protocol with pre-defined rules and a strict message format that uses only XML***. ***REST is an architectural style*** with recommendations and constraints that can use any media-type like XML, JSON, or plain text. Here is a table that summarizes some of the key differences between SOAP and REST:

| SOAP | REST |
|------|------|
| Stands for Simple Object Access Protocol | Stands for Representational State Transfer |
| Uses XML as the only data format | Can use any data format, such as XML, JSON, HTML, or plain text |
| Exposes application logic as services | Accesses named resources through a consistent interface |
| Operates through different interfaces for different operations | Operates through a single interface for all operations (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| Requires a SOAP envelope to wrap the message | Does not need any wrapper for the message |
| Supports complex transactions and distributed systems | Supports simple and stateless interactions |
| Can handle binary data and attachments | Relies on base64 encoding for binary data |
| Can use different transport protocols (such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP) | Based on HTTP only |
| More secure and standardized | More flexible and simple |
