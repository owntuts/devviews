  <summary><h5>Debouncing and Throttling</h5></summary>

Debouncing and throttling are two techniques that can help you optimize the performance of your JavaScript code.

- **Debouncing** is like ***waiting for someone to finish talking before you reply***. For example, if you are having a phone conversation with your friend, and they keep interrupting themselves with "um", "uh", or "sorry", you don't want to respond to every word they say. You want to wait until they finish their sentence or their thought before you say something back. This way, you avoid unnecessary interruptions and misunderstandings. Similarly, debouncing a function means that you ***delay the execution of the function until the event stops*** occurring for a certain period of time. This way, you avoid unnecessary calls to the function and reduce the load on your server.
- **Throttling** is like ***limiting how much water you use when you shower***. For example, if you are taking a shower, and you want to save water and energy, you don't want to keep the water running at full blast all the time. You want to adjust the water pressure or turn off the faucet at regular intervals. This way, you ensure that you have enough water for your shower, but not more than you need. Similarly, throttling a function means that you ***limit the number of times a function can be executed in a given time interval***. This way, you ensure that the function is not called too frequently and does not affect the smoothness of the scrolling.
