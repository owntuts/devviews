# Common Software development principles

Software development principles are general guidelines or best practices that help developers create high-quality software that meets the customer's needs and expectations. There are many software development principles, but some of the most common ones are:

- **Agile principles**: These are based on the Agile Manifesto, which is a statement of values and principles for software development that emphasizes customer satisfaction, collaboration, flexibility, and working software. Some of the agile principles are¹:
    * Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
    * Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
    * Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    * Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    * The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
    * Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    * Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    * Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
    * The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    * At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

- **SOLID principles**: These are a set of design principles for object-oriented programming that help developers create maintainable, extensible, and testable code. SOLID stands for²:
    * Single responsibility principle: A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
    * Open-closed principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.
    * Liskov substitution principle: Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class. This means that a subclass should override the parent class methods in a way that does not break functionality from a client’s point of view.
    * Interface segregation principle: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
    * Dependency inversion principle: Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

- **DRY principle**: This stands for Don't Repeat Yourself, which means that every piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous representation within a system. This helps developers avoid duplication and redundancy in code, which can lead to bugs, inconsistencies, and difficulties in maintenance³.

- **KISS principle**: This stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid, which means that developers should aim for simplicity and clarity in their code and design. This helps developers avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering, which can make code harder to understand, test, debug, and modify.

- **YAGNI principle**: This stands for You Aren't Gonna Need It, which means that developers should only implement things when they actually need them, not when they foresee or speculate that they might need them in the future. This helps developers avoid wasting time and effort on features or functionalities that may never be used or may change significantly later.

- **Separation of concerns**: This means that a system should be divided into distinct and independent modules or components that each have a clear and well-defined responsibility. This helps developers achieve high cohesion and low coupling, which improve modularity, readability, reusability, and testability of code.
