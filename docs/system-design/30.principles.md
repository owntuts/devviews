#### Procedural Programming vs IoC

- In procedural programming, the code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom (program) code.

#### DI vs IoC

- **DI** is a technique for ***injecting dependencies into an object***, while **IoC (Inversion of Control)** is a design principle that shifts the control of object creation from the client to a ***third-party container***. The ***container can provide more features*** such as auto injecting, managing dependencies, and resolving conflicts.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between DI and IoC:

| Feature | DI | IoC |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | A technique for injecting dependencies into an object. | A design principle that shifts the control of object creation from the client to a third-party container. |
| Scope | Specific | General |
| Implementation | Typically implemented using dependency injection frameworks. | Can be implemented in a variety of ways, including dependency injection frameworks, service locators, and container-based programming. |
| Benefits | * Loose coupling. * Testability. * Extensibility. | * Loose coupling. * Testability. * Extensibility. * Auto injecting. * Managing dependencies. * Resolving conflicts. |

Here is an example of how IoC works in practice:

```java
// In procedural programming, you would do this:

class MyClass {
  public void doSomething() {
    // This code would create a new instance of the Logger class.
    Logger logger = new Logger();
    logger.log("Something happened");
  }
}

// With IoC, you would do this:

class MyClass {
  public void doSomething() {
    // This code would not create a new instance of the Logger class.
    // Instead, it would ask the IoC container to create a Logger instance for it.
    Logger logger = getIoCContainer().getLogger();
    logger.log("Something happened");
  }
}
```

Here is an example of how DI works:

```java
class MyClass {
  private Logger logger;

  public MyClass(Logger logger) {
    this.logger = logger;
  }

  public void doSomething() {
    logger.log("Something happened");
  }
}
```
