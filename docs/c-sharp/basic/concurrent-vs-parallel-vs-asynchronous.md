Concurrent vs Parallel vs Asynchronous

:::

<details>
  <summary><h5>ANSWER:</h5></summary>

  \***`◔̯◔`**\* :

**1. Synchronous execution**: doing things one after the another.

**2. Asynchronous**: not having to wait for one task to finish before starting another. (i.e, The execution thread should not wait for an I/O-bound or CPU-bound task to finish.)

**3. Concurrent**: doing multiple things at the same time. (i.e, Multiple threads run in the background.)

**4. Parallel**: doing multiple copies of something at the same time.
