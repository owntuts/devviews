App vs Project in Django?

  <summary><h5>ANSWER:</h5></summary>

  \***`◔̯◔`**\* :

**A project** can consist of multiple apps and each app can be included in multiple projects. A project contains the settings and configurations for the ***entire website***, such as the database connection, middleware, URL routing, and installed apps. A Django project can be thought of as the top-level container for the codebase that represents a complete web application.


**An app** is a ***self-contained module*** that provides a specific functionality to the website. An app can contain models, views, templates, static files, and other components needed ***to achieve a specific task or feature***. An app can be reused across different projects, so it provides a way to share functionality between projects.

#### include an app into a Django project

1.
```py
python manage.py startapp myapp
```
This will create a directory called `myapp` in your project directory that contains the app's components, such as the `models.py`, `views.py`, `templates/` and `static/` directories.

2. In your project's settings file (usually `settings.py`), add the name of the app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps...
    'myapp',
]
```

3. Define URLs for the app: Define the URLs for the app in your project's URL configuration file (usually `urls.py`).
```py
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    # other URL patterns...
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]

```

4. 
```py
python manage.py runserver

```
