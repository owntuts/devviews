  \***`◔̯◔`**\* :

1. **Django Admin Interface**
Django Admin is a built-in web-based interface provided by Django that allows you to manage your website's content and configuration. 
Django provides an easy-to-use interface for ***adding, removing, and modifying data*** stored in databases. By defining models in Python code, Django can ***automatically generate CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete)*** views for that model. You can also customize the look and feel of the admin interface by creating your own ***templates, stylesheets, and custom views***.
Django Admin also includes several features that make it easy to manage your website's content and configuration, including:
- Search: You can quickly find records by using the search box located at the top of the admin interface.
- Filtering: You can filter records by specifying criteria that are used to narrow down the list of records displayed in the interface.
- Pagination: You can control how many records are displayed on each page of the interface to help you manage large datasets.
- Inline editing: You can edit related data inline within the form of the main record being edited.
Grouping: You can group records together based on certain criteria, making it easier to navigate large datasets.
