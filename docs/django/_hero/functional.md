<summary><h5>Functional programming in Python</h5></summary>

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on using pure functions, which are functions that have no side effects and depend only on their inputs and outputs. Python has some features that enable functional programming, such as:

- The `lambda` keyword can be used to define anonymous functions, which are useful for creating short and concise functions that can be used in higher-order functions.
- The `map ()`, `filter ()`, and `reduce ()` functions can be used to apply a function to an iterable, select elements from an iterable based on a condition, or reduce an iterable to a single value, respectively.
- The `itertools` and `functools` modules provide additional tools for functional programming, such as **iterators**, **generators**, **decorators**, **partial functions**, and more.

However, Python is not a purely functional language, as it also supports other paradigms such as procedural and object-oriented programming.
