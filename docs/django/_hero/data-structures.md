![data-structure](/img/interviews/python/data-structure.png)

Python has several built-in data types that can be used to store and manipulate different kinds of values. Some of the most common built-in data types in Python are:

- Numeric data types: These are data types that represent numbers, such as integers, floats, and complex numbers. Examples: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- String data type: This is a data type that represents a sequence of characters, such as words, sentences, or text. Example: `str`
- Sequence data types: These are data types that represent ordered collections of items, such as lists, tuples, and ranges. Examples: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
- Mapping data type: This is a data type that represents an unordered collection of key-value pairs, such as dictionaries. Example: `dict`
- Set data types: These are data types that represent unordered collections of unique items, such as sets and frozensets. Examples: `set`, `frozenset`
- Boolean data type: This is a data type that represents a logical value, either True or False. Example: `bool`
- Binary data types: These are data types that represent sequences of bytes, such as bytes, bytearrays, and memoryviews. Examples: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`

<summary><h5>mutable and immutable data type in python</h5></summary>

- **Mutable data types**: These are data types that can be changed after they are created. Examples are list, set, dictionary, bytearray, etc.
- **Immutable data types**: These are data types that cannot be changed after they are created. Examples are int, float, string, tuple, bool, bytes, etc.

<summary><h5>Arrays vs lists</h5></summary>

| Feature | Array | List |
|---------|-------|------|
| Built-in | No, need to import | Yes |
| Data type | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous |
| Arithmetic operations | Supported | Not supported |
| Sequence length | Preferred for longer | Preferred for shorter |
| Flexibility and modification | Less | More |

```python
import array
a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3])
for i in a:
    print(i, end=' ')    #OUTPUT: 1 2 3
a = array.array('i', [1, 2, 'string'])    #OUTPUT: TypeError: an integer is required (got type str)
a = [1, 2, 'string']
for i in a:
   print(i, end=' ')    #OUTPUT: 1 2 string
```

<summary><h5>list vs tuple vs range</h5></summary>

List, tuple and range are three built-in data types in Python that represent sequences of values. They have some similarities and differences in terms of syntax, mutability, methods and use cases. Here is a table that summarizes some of the main points to compare list, tuple and range with examples:

| List | Tuple | Range |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| A list is an ***ordered and mutable collection*** of items, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets. | A tuple is an ***ordered and immutable collection*** of items, separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses. | A range is an ***immutable sequence of numbers***, generated by the `range()` function. |
| Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']` | Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c')` | Example: `my_range = range(1, 10, 2)` |
| A list can be modified after its creation, such as adding, removing or changing items. | A tuple cannot be modified after its creation, except by converting it to a list and back. | A range cannot be modified after its creation, but it can be sliced or iterated over. |
| A list has many built-in methods to manipulate its items, such as `append()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc. | A tuple has only two built-in methods: `count()` and `index()`. | A range has no built-in methods, but it supports some common operations such as `len()`, `min()`, `max()`, in, etc. |
| A list is used to store and manipulate heterogeneous or homogeneous data that can change over time. It is also used to implement stacks and queues. | A tuple is used to store and access heterogeneous or homogeneous data that cannot or should not change over time. It is also used to return multiple values from a function or to unpack multiple values from a sequence. | A range is used to generate a sequence of numbers for looping or indexing purposes. It is also used to create arithmetic progressions. |
