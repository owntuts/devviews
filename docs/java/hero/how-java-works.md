Java is a programming language that works by following these steps:

- A programmer writes a Java source code file with a .java extension, such as Program.java.
- The Java compiler (javac) converts the source code into bytecode, which is a platform-independent representation of the program. The bytecode file has a .class extension, such as Program.class.
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets the bytecode and executes it on the underlying hardware. The JVM is a software layer that provides an abstract interface between the bytecode and the operating system. The JVM can run on any device that has a compatible version of it installed.
- The JVM also performs various tasks such as memory management, garbage collection, security checks, exception handling, etc. to ensure the smooth and efficient execution of the program.

This is how Java works and enables the "write once, run anywhere" feature. Java programs can run on any device that has a JVM, regardless of the hardware or operating system differences.
