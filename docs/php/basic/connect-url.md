  <summary><h5>ANSWER:</h5></summary>

  \***`◔̯◔`**\* :
You can use various functions in PHP to connect to a URL, depending on what you want to do with the URL. Here are some examples:

**1️⃣ Using `file_get_contents()`**: This function allows you to retrieve the contents of a URL as a string. You can use this function to fetch HTML pages, RSS feeds, or any other text-based content. Here's an example:
```php
$url = 'http://www.example.com';
$html = file_get_contents($url);
echo $html;
```

**2️⃣ Using `fopen()`, `fgets()`, and `fclose()`**: These functions allow you to open a connection to a URL and read its contents line by line. You can use this method to fetch large files or data streams. Here's an example:
```php
$url = 'http://www.example.com/largefile.zip';
$file = fopen($url, 'r');
while (!feof($file)) {
  echo fgets($file, 1024);
}
fclose($file);
```

**3️⃣ Using cURL**: cURL is a PHP library that allows you to connect to URLs and perform various operations, such as fetching content, uploading files, or sending POST requests. Here's an example:
```php
$url = 'http://www.example.com';
$ch = curl_init($url);

// Set cURL options
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$html = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

echo $html;
```
In summary, there are several ways to connect to a URL in PHP, depending on what you want to do with the URL. You can use `file_get_contents()` to retrieve content as a string, `fopen()`, `fgets()`, and `fclose()` to read large files, or cURL to perform more advanced operations.
