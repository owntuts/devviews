  \***`◔̯◔`**\* :
In PHP, a session is a mechanism that allows ***a server to store information about a user across multiple requests***.

When a user first visits a website, a unique session ID is generated by the server and stored in a cookie on the user's browser, or added to the URL if cookies are disabled. Subsequent requests from the same user will include this session ID, allowing the server to retrieve any stored session data.

Session data can be used to store information about the user, such as their username or shopping cart contents. This information can be accessed across multiple pages or even multiple sessions ***until the user closes their browser or the session expires***.

Here's an example of how to start a session and store data in it:

```php
// Start the session
session_start();

// Store data in the session
$_SESSION['username'] = 'john_doe';
$_SESSION['cart'] = array('product1', 'product2', 'product3');

```
To retrieve data from the session, we can simply access the `$_SESSION` variable again:

```php
// Retrieve data from the session
$username = $_SESSION['username'];
$cart = $_SESSION['cart'];
```
